How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff exactly points out the diffrence.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Thats gives me more courage to play with code... And let me make the changes 
	despite of the size of the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatic saving Takes care of every changes we make... and increases confidence.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Coz in some type of coding, we need to involve multiple files. Thus its a good 
	feature to have the facility to commit multiple related files together.
		But in case of Google Docs, generally inter file correlation dosen't exit 
	much hence its okey to have one file one commit policy.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Using git log I can exactly find out the commits I have done and also can compare 
	datas b/w among the commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    With branching I am now more versatile developer than ever, for I can play with my
	code without taking any risks.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I can use Git for Developing anything...
